## Overview

Octa Enigma is a sophisticated token monitoring engine that tracks **DEX profile changes** and credibility signals across multiple decentralized exchanges. Unlike traditional price trackers, it alerts subscribers when tokens gain legitimacy through verified profile updates, community takeovers, and other credibility markers—before the price pumps become obvious to the market.

## The Problem

Crypto markets move fast, but price alone is a lagging indicator. A token might have potential (good meme, strong community) but traders hesitate to enter until it receives credibility signals. By the time price moves, the best entry is gone.

Octa Enigma solves this by monitoring **what happens before the price pumps**:
- DEX profile updates and verifications
- Social link additions
- Community takeover events
- Liquidity milestones
- Developer activity signals

## Key Features

- **DEX Profile Monitoring**: Tracks profile updates, verifications, and credibility markers
- **Smart Entry Signals**: Alerts when tokens gain legitimacy but haven't pumped yet
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket connections to multiple data sources
- **Noise Filtering**: Surfaces only significant credibility events
- **Instant Alerts**: Sub-400ms latency from detection to Telegram delivery

## How It Works

1. **Monitor**: Watches DEX Screener profiles for update events
2. **Analyze**: Evaluates the significance of profile changes
3. **Score**: Assigns credibility score based on multiple signals
4. **Alert**: Notifies subscribers of high-potential opportunities

## Architecture

Event-driven architecture with multiple redundant data sources ensuring 99.9% uptime. Uses Redis for hot caching and PostgreSQL for historical analysis.

## Performance

- **Throughput**: 10,000+ events per second
- **Latency**: P95 under 100ms from profile update to alert
- **Uptime**: 99.9% over 6 months of operation
