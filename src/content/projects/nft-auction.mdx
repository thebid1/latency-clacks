## Overview

A **confidential NFT auction platform** built on Solana leveraging **Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** technology. Enables sealed-bid auctions where bid amounts remain encrypted and private until the auction ends—ensuring fair price discovery without front-running or bid sniping.

## Status

🚧 **Currently Building**

This project is under active development on the Solana devnet. Smart contracts are being written in Rust with Anchor framework, integrating Arcium's confidential computing infrastructure.

## The Concept

Traditional NFT auctions have a major flaw: **bid visibility**. When bids are public, sniping and psychological manipulation distort price discovery. Sellers don't get fair market value, and buyers pay more than necessary.

Our solution uses **Arcium MPC** (Multi-Party Computation):
- Bids are encrypted using Arcium's confidential computing network
- No single party can see bids until reveal phase
- Computation happens on encrypted data
- True sealed-bid mechanics on a public blockchain

## Tech Stack

- **Rust + Anchor**: Solana smart contract development
- **Arcium MPC**: Confidential computing and encryption
- **Solana**: High-performance L1 blockchain
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework
- **IPFS**: Decentralized metadata storage

## Planned Features

- **Confidential Bids**: Encrypted using Arcium's MPC network
- **Anti-Sniping**: Impossible to front-run or game
- **Fair Price Discovery**: True market value for both parties
- **On-Chain Settlement**: Guaranteed execution via Solana

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for the devnet launch announcement. The dApp will be deployed to Solana devnet first for testing, followed by a mainnet launch after security audits are complete.
