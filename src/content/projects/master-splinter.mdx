## Overview

Master Splinter is an automated monitoring system that tracks new token pairs on decentralized exchanges, filtering noise to surface high-potential opportunities within seconds of launch.

## The Problem

Manual monitoring of new token launches on decentralized exchanges is inefficient. By the time a human spots an opportunity, it's often too late, the best entries are gone, or worse, it's a rug pull.

## Key Features

- **Speed**: Alerts within seconds of token creation
- **Smart Filtering**: Liquidity checks, contract verification, blacklist screening
- **Rich Context**: Contract details, social links, and liquidity info instantly
- **Deduplication**: Redis cache prevents alert spam

## Architecture

Polling-based architecture with WebSocket fallbacks:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Monitors Dexscreener API continuously
2. **Filtering Layer**: Applies configurable rules (min liquidity, verified contracts, etc.)
3. **Deduplication**: Redis cache prevents duplicate alerts
4. **Broadcast**: Telegram Bot API delivers formatted messages instantly

## Results

- **Alert Latency**: Average 3.2 seconds from token creation to Telegram
- **Daily Alerts**: Curated list of quality opportunities
- **User Retention**: High engagement from active traders
